      description: "Every community call gets recorded. Every design file lives in open repos. Every half-baked idea gets posted in Discord. At first this was terrifying - who wants their rough sketches seen by hundreds? But transparency became our superpower. New designers ship faster because they see everyone else's messy process. No gatekeeping, no perfect portfolios required."
