      description: "The original vision for the Bitcoin Design Community and Design Guide remains unchanged: to create best practice guidelines for the unique challenges of Bitcoin product design, and to empower builders with resources that accelerate development and promote consistency across the decentralized ecosystem.<br/><br/>Over the past five years, it’s been rewarding to see a resilient core community take shape, a foundational Design Guide emerge, and a range of impactful projects come to life. Looking ahead, we must evolve with the tools of our time—particularly by embracing AI’s growing role in product design, prototyping, and development.<br/><br/>To keep pace, the Design Guide must reflect this shift, and we must actively attract and support world-class designers to make the community and guide indispensable to building great Bitcoin products."
