It's not lost on me how incredibly lucky I am to wake up each day and work on Bitcoin products.<br/><br/>The responsibility of delivering high-quality work feels heightened in many ways. There's no boss assigning tasks or deadlines, just a goal. It's entirely up to me to set standards and deliver at a level I feel proud of, which means doing the absolute best I can.<br/><br/>During my grant period I initially set out to write the ecash section of the Bitcoin Design Guide. Over time, I expanded my contributions into several other projects.",

      description: "The past few years have been quite the ride, and in some ways I feel like I'm just getting started! There are several interesting problems to work on. Sometimes the road takes you back to where you've already been, but reveals new and interesting parts of town.<br/><br/>That's what happened to me with payjoin. I did a UX case study on payjoin in 2023, but recently async payjoin has breathed new life into a protocol that failed to gain traction. Liana wallet is a great example of this renewal, who want to help users refresh timelocks with payjoin, and I can't wait to dive head on into this fascinating problem!",

      description: "Looking back at my journey through the bitcoin ecosystem, it's been quite the evolution from where I started. I began as a curious researcher diving into Bitcoin Core App UX, trying to understand how people actually interact with this technology. The more I dug in, the more I realized we were missing something fundamental - we weren't designing for the people who need bitcoin most. That realization lit a fire under me to become a voice for those users whose stories weren't being heard.<br/><br/>In that first year, working alongside incredible collaborators and we built the research toolkit that would become a foundation for others. The Spiral grant gave me the space to really go deep on this work, and before I knew it, I found myself co-founding the Bitcoin Design Foundation with Christoph and Daniel. Soon after that travelling to Africa and South America, and chasing the dream of having a bitcoin UX designer on every continent. What started as individual research project has somehow grown into a mission to transform how we think about bitcoin design globally. The ecosystem didn't just teach me about bitcoin - it transformed me from someone studying this technology to someone who gets to actively shape how we build it for the people who need it most. Every day I'm reminded how incredibly fortunate I am to do this work and to collaborate with the passionate people who make it all possible.",

      description: "I first got to know about the Bitcoin Core App in late 2022, when I came across the Bitcoin Design Community. After some lurking around on their Slack (now Discord), I created a new Figma file and started contributing to the project. At the same time, I took part in the community’s first Designathon. Together with Gene, we worked on a design concept for an inheritance wallet. Surprisingly, we ended up in 1st place.<br/><br/>These two experiences nudged me further to pursue a career in the Bitcoin space. I received a design grant from Spiral, to contribute inheritance-related content to the Bitcoin Design Guide.<br/><br/>The decision to get involved with the Bitcoin Design Community was a turning point for me and I want to see the Bitcoin Core App project succeed.",
