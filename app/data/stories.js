      description: "Over the last few months I’ve had the privilege of being supported by the Bitcoin Design Foundation as one of their grantees. It's not lost on me how incredibly lucky I am to wake up each day and work on Bitcoin products.<br/><br/>The responsibility of delivering high-quality work feels heightened in many ways. There's no boss assigning tasks or deadlines, just a goal. It's entirely up to me to set standards and deliver at a level I feel proud of, which means doing the absolute best I can.<br/><br/>During my grant period I initially set out to write the ecash section of the Bitcoin Design Guide. Over time, I expanded my contributions into several other projects.",

      description: "The past few years have been quite the ride, and in some ways I feel like I'm just getting started! There are several interesting problems to work on. Sometimes the road takes you back to where you've already been, but reveals new and interesting parts of town.<br/><br/>That's what happened to me with payjoin. I did a UX case study on payjoin in 2023, but recently async payjoin has breathed new life into a protocol that failed to gain traction. Liana wallet is a great example of this renewal, who want to help users refresh timelocks with payjoin, and I can't wait to dive head on into this fascinating problem!",

      impact: "The UX of complex privacy protocols is much better understood and on the road to implementation."

      description: "I first got to know about the Bitcoin Core App in late 2022, when I came across the Bitcoin Design Community. After some lurking around on their Slack (now Discord), I created a new Figma file and started contributing to the project. At the same time, I took part in the community’s first Designathon. Together with Gene, we worked on a design concept for an inheritance wallet. Surprisingly, we ended up in 1st place.<br/><br/>These two experiences nudged me further to pursue a career in the Bitcoin space. I received a design grant from Spiral, to contribute inheritance-related content to the Bitcoin Design Guide.<br/><br/>The decision to get involved with the Bitcoin Design Community was a turning point for me and I want to see the Bitcoin Core App project succeed.",
